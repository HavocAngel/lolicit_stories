Shren jumped off his bed, looking at the clock. 7 AM! I'm running late! he thought to himself. Shren pulled on a pair of pants and a shirt, ran a comb through his hair without looking, and sprayed himself with a quick layer of Axe. Looking around his room, he suddenly remembered his flash drive. He dove into his epic sized laundry pile and fished it out of yesterday's pants. Wouldn't want to forget this... he thought mischevously.

Shren threw down a granola bar and a cup of milk and flew out the door to his bus stop. He made it to the place where the bus stops just in time - 7:10 - and the bus rolled to a stop just as he arrived, panting, at the place. His neighbors rolled their eyes and climbed on the bus, and Shren took his normal place, alone, in the front left seat on the bus. As the bus cranked into first gear and the door whined shut, he began to think of his awesome upcoming day at school.

Shren was 14 years old and attending high school in America, having arrived from Japan ten years back. He spoke fluent English with nearly no accent, and had found his calling in online role playing games. And on the flash drive was the latest free to play game - Fare's champions.



The bus pulled into the parking lot and Shren was the first one off. He dashed towards the orchestra room, and one of the coolest teachers he had ever met - Mr. Mayer. Mr. Mayer was a stocky and short teacher, at 5' 1'', and he played the most instruments in the best style that Shren had ever seen. And, what's more, is Mr. Mayer allowed Shren - with the proper excuses, of course - to use his laptop during the day. Mr. Mayer himself was into MMOs, and he didn't mind letting Shren ditch class, as long as he didn't get in trouble.

&quot;Good morning, Mr. Mayer!&quot; Shren exclaimed when walking into the nearly empty orchestra room.

&quot;Morning, Shren. You going to class todaY?&quot; Mr. Mayer took a sip from his coffee cup, which contained the only kind of coffee he'd drink - Dunkin' Donuts Espresso.

&quot;Nah, I have a new game and am dying to try it.&quot;

&quot;What game?&quot; Mr. Mayer was interested - he didn't know any games were due for release.

&quot;Fare's Champions. It's another sword swinger, but it looks pretty fun and it's free.&quot;



&quot;Alright.&quot; Mr. Mayer pulled out his cell phone and dialed the attendance office. &quot;Hello, my son, Shren Malkai, won't be attending class today. He's sick with the flu, and he's at home, in bed. His ID Number is 729-699. Thanks, Lee Malkai.&quot; He looked at Shren mischeviously. &quot;Thats the beauty of calling early in the morning - you get the answering machine and nobody asks any questions.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Mr. Mayer.&quot;

Shren ran into Mr. Mayer's office suite, went into the back room and shut the door. This way, he wouldn't be visible to the students of Mr. Mayer's classes. He plugged his flash drive into the laptop behind the desk, and opened it up. Typing in the password - Mozart1756 - he pulled the drive up and double clicked on the crossed swords icon.

The loading screen showed a cartoon mage with a rapier at his belt and a flame in his hand. &quot;Awesome!&quot; Shren said, admiring the work that the developers had put into the game. The game pulled into a character creation screen, and he made a character called ShrenAttack. His character was medium build, with long and dark hair going to his waist and a nice leather jacket.

&quot;Sweet,&quot; Shren exclaimed, before diving into the game.



After gaining a few levels, Shren started to get bored. He looked at the clock and sighed - only one period had passed. He opened the in game console and typed a message to his teammate.

So, how old are you? I'm 14, he typed into the console.

13 came the response from UriMan113.

And where do you liVe? Shren pressed.

Colorado Springs responded UriMan.

Shren's heart lept a beat. That was the same town he lived in - and if he was 13, he'd be going to Marcus Trennan Middle School. Me too! Skipping class? he replied.

Yea, this game is supposed to be good UriMan sent back.

Shren scratched his head, and replied with, Hey, want to meet up? I'm sure we could have fun talkin about the game!

where came the response.

yukon's castle, in 20 minutes? asked Shren.

be there or be square said Uri, and he logged out.

&quot;Awesome!&quot; Shren said out loud, and shut the laptop. He looked at the clock - Mr. Mayer had a free period second.




Shren crept out of the back room to find Mr. Mayer on his school issued desktop computer. &quot;Bored?&quot; Mr. Mayer teased.

&quot;No, I have to go for a bit. I'll be back later? Or maybe not.&quot; Shren twisted his fingers together as he said this. &quot;I left the game drive - maybe try it, its fun.&quot;

Shren walked out the orchestra room door to the outside. It was raining - just what he needed - and he walked for 15 minutes with his hood pulled up, to the Yukon's Castle Diner. When he arrived, there was almost nobody there, save for the staff and a girl in the corner. Shren sat down and ordered a coke.

45 minutes passed, and nobody else came to the diner. Shren was about to get up, when he felt someone tapping on his back. &quot;Are you Shren?&quot; the girl said to him. Shren turned around, stunned, and looked into the most beautiful face he'd ever seen in his entire life. 
&quot;Y-yes,&quot; he stuttered, stunned by the perfect little girl he was seeing.

&quot;Hi! Uria,&quot; said the girl, extending her hand. She was wearing tight jeans and a loose fitting button down shirt. Her hair went down to her shoulder blades and was chocolate brown. Her eyes were the exact same shade and the two most beautiful eyes Shren had ever seen. She was wearing lip gloss that made her lips very appealing, and she didn't have and other makeup on besides.

&quot;Shren Malkai,&quot; Shren said, taking her warm hand and shuddering at the feel of it. This was easily the most beautiful girl he'd ever talked to. &quot;I'm 14.&quot;

&quot;So - ditching school like me?&quot; Uria said slyly. &quot;That game is really something else. I would have paid for it..&quot;

&quot;Yeah - how come you were playing?&quot; Shren managed to say. &quot;Not that there's anything wr-&quot;

&quot;What? A girl can't play a game?&quot; She smiled a crooked smile at Shren - did she know that he was stunned by her very appearance?



&quot;Have you had breakfast yet?&quot; Uria inquired.

&quot;Not much - just a little something. I was running late.&quot;

&quot;Running late to ditch school?&quot; Uria inquired. She looked so beautiful when she was confused - Focus, Shren.

&quot;Yes, I actually ditched school at school.&quot;

&quot;That's pretty clever - I assume one of your teachers helped you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, my orchestra teacher is cool. So wait, you're 13?&quot; Shren's heart skipped another beat.

&quot;Yes.. I go to Marcus Middle. Want to head to my place? My parents are, like, rich, so we have a pretty cool setup.&quot;

Shren knew that the game was the last thing he was thinking of, but he was hasty to give this girl anything she wanted. &quot;Yeah, sure. Are your parents home?&quot;

&quot;Nah, they have to work. In fact, they might not even be home tonight.&quot; She sighed. &quot;I wish I had someone to hang out with - but no other girls my age like games like I do.&quot;

They stepped out of the diner, and Uria led the way to her house.



Shren gasped as they approached a humongus house in the woods. &quot;Don't tell me thats your place!&quot; he stammered.

Uria rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah, dummy, this is where I live.&quot;

They walked to the front door, and Uria pulled out a big key and slipped it into the door. They stepped inside the cool house and she closed the door. &quot;Here we are - home sweet home.&quot; She walked upstairs to her room with Shren leading the way, and closed the door behind him. &quot;Here's my room - nothing special.&quot;

The room was ringed with blue - a pleasant bright color on the walls. In the corner was a large bed, and next to it was a desk with a really nice computer on it. There was a webcam and a mic, as well as a gaming mouse, a joystick, and a wireless keyboard. She had one of those surround sound chairs and a subwoofer - Her parents must really be loaded Shren thought to himself.

Uria jumped on the bed. She took her shoes off and tossed them into the corner.

&quot;So what did you have in mind?&quot; Shren asked. His eyes were trapped onto her body, her frame. He kept thinking about how beautiful she was.

&quot;Well, I was wondering - do you want to be my boyfriend?&quot; She asked completely matter of factly.

Shren looked at her, and again his heart lept. This time, he felt a bulge growing in his pants. &quot;What, like you'd be my girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, silly - that's what a boyfriend is.&quot; She raised an eyebrow inquisitively, as if she wasn't sure about his intelligence.

&quot;S-Sure..&quot; said Shren. He was getting a bit sweaty, and went to sit next to her to hide his growing erection.

She abruptly grabbed his hand and kissed it. &quot;I'm glad I finally have someone to be with..&quot; She looked on the verge of tears. &quot;I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't met you.&quot;

Shren didn't know what to say. &quot;I'm glad, too.&quot; He managed to get out.

&quot;So.. want to play truth or dare?&quot; Her eyes had a mischevous tint.


&quot;Um..&quot; Shren was getting really aroused, and was worried that she might notice. &quot;Y-yeah, if you want..&quot; He looked at her small bumps, and another drop of sweat fell down his neck.

&quot;Okay, I'll start. Truth or dare?&quot;

&quot;Truth,&quot; Shren gulped.

&quot;Okay - is it true that you are staring at my boobs?&quot; She raised an eyebrow and smiled a mischevious smile.

Shren's eyes widened. He looked into her eyes and was stunned into nonbeing again. He had known this girl all of an hour, and she was already making moves on him. And with the stranglehold that she had on his mind, there was no way he could lie. &quot;Y-yes,&quot; he murmured.

&quot;Haha. Okay, now your turn.&quot; Her smile was warm, encouraging, with the tiny hint of rebellion.

&quot;Truth or dare?&quot; Shren was getting worried about his sanity. She was so drop dead gorgeous that he didn't know how much longer he'd be able to keep from humping the chairs.

&quot;Dare!&quot; she exclaimed, a glint of triumph in her eye. There was something else there too - nervousness, maybe?



&quot;I dare you to.. kiss me on the cheek.&quot; Shren's erection pulsed, but he ignored it. He'd be doing this the right way.. but what was the right way? He'd never had a girlfriend, had never even seen another girl's private parts.

She didn't even hesitate. She streched her body up to his face and planted the most delicate but passionate peck onto his cheek that he would ever have. He became dazed - he had just been kissed by a girl for the first time.

&quot;Uh... uhh...&quot; he breathed. He didn't know what to say.

&quot;Ssh.. my turn. Truth or dare?&quot; She looked into his eyes, as if she knew that whatever one he picked, she'd win anyway.

&quot;T-Truth.&quot;

&quot;Is it true that you've never had a girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Uh.. yes.&quot; He thought she might be disappointed. Quite on the contrary, she looked relieved.

&quot;Me either - a boyfriend, I mean.&quot; She chanced a sideways look into his eyes - all of a sudden, she looked as nervous as he felt. &quot;Your turn..&quot; she trailed off.

&quot;Truth or dare?&quot; He muttered.

&quot;Dare!&quot; She liked living on the wild side.

&quot;I dare you to kiss me on the lips!&quot; He was starting to get as excited as she was.

Uria looked at Shren nervously, but then streched up again and put her mouth to his. Shren opened his, like he had seen on TV. This turned it into much more than just a kiss on the lips. Shren tried to lick his lips, because they were dry, then remembered that he couldn't because of Uria. Uria responded to the movement of his tounge by putting her own in, and he sucked on it for a few moments, and then broke it off. She had the most caring look in her eyes as she pulled herself off his body.

&quot;Wow. That was amazing.. was that a french kiss?&quot; She asked him.

&quot;I don't know.. but its your turn now!&quot; He was ready for her to ask.

&quot;Truth or dare?&quot;

&quot;Dare.&quot;



Uria looked very triumphant as she said, &quot;I dare you to put your hand up my shirt!&quot;

Shren's eyes bulged out of his head. &quot;A-are you sure?!&quot; he questioned.

&quot;When a girl tells you to touch her boobs, you don't argue with her,&quot; she teased. She scooted closer to Shren and put her front almost against his. He extended a hand sheepishly and reached under her shirt.

Her stomach was the most smooth and warm thing he had ever felt. He would have just kept his hand there for the rest of his life if he hadn't remembered that he was on a mission. He slowly traced his hand up her stomach, to her chest, and found a nipple. He traced the outside, and at his touch Uria moaned and shuddered. She looked into his eyes with the most longing, and at that moment, though young he was, there was nothing Shren wanted in the entire world than to spend every moment left in his life with this girl.

He slowly pulled his hand out of her shirt and fell back. Uria grabbed his hand and held it in hers gently.

&quot;Truth or dare?&quot; Shren asked.

&quot;Dare.&quot;

&quot;I dare you.. t-to put your hand in my pants.&quot; He looked down, but she took her hand and brought his chin up to look at her. With her other hand, she deliberately unbuttoned his pants and pulled them off completely, revaling his boxers and his boner. She looked down with an innocent glittering in her eye, and she touched his boner.

Shren went crazy with pleasure and anticipation. He collected himself and said, &quot;That felt.. really good.&quot;

Uria raised a single eyebrow and fell back. &quot;Truth or dare, then?&quot;


Shren deliberated, and said, &quot;Dare.&quot;

&quot;I dare you to pull your boxers off,&quot; she whispered. A longing and lust was in her eyes that Shren had never seen anywhere. He knew that if she had told him to jump off a bridge, that he would have happily done so.
