It was a bright day, with the sun shining. Cicada's made noise that dominated almost all sounds. He stumbles into his home. Eyes are blood shot, ears ringing with a noise indescribable. Pain surges. He grabs a bottle of aspirin and dry-swallows a few. He stumbles up some stairs and falls into his room. He falls to the floor crying. Stop. Stop was all he could think. Thoughts grew out of control. Paranoia sets in. Ready to scream and choking on his own breathe. Silence.

The world moves on. Thoughts echo. Silence is the loudest noise. Nothing is there. You sit alone. Voices stir, and thoughts trail. Lost inside your own mind.

His body falls numb. Mind slips from existence. Drowning inside of his own thoughts. Fear. Struggling to keep his head above the surface. Glass shatters. Lost for time, the fragments fall. Deep inside they fester. An entity is formed. Alone, it claws to the surface. His mind trembles. A stranger to himself.

Fallen to pieces. True self is lost. The questions rings. Who am I? An answer comes to the surface. Logic of thoughts for to one. Exploring the darkness. Mind unsettles. The lost stirs.

Searching for the fragment. Looking for significance. Searching deeper and deeper. Losing himself inside. Feelings fade, and hope becomes lost. The thought sparks fire. Eyes open, throat burning. The lights go on, all doors rip open. Piercing through himself, goals become clear. He gets his teeth and claws. Nothing can make him turn down now. He hits the ground running. No matter how hard he hits the ground he gets up.

Cannot look in another direction. Clear as day, keep moving forward. Claw your way back to life. Failure is not an option. Trying can only be success or more trying. No turning back, no giving up. You hit the world, with all that you have or die trying. Impact will consume it all.

He struggles. He can never give in, never give up. Internal conflict is weakness. He has to make something out of everything. Together he becomes a whole. Embracing the good and the bad. No one can stop him. Everyone is afraid. No one can stare him down. Every stare every glance, lasts forever. The impact is eternal. The world has yet to see what he is capable of. No one will forget. An eternal story.

The good and bad. It all comes in the same turn. The light casts shadows. Saviors and villains all follow the same path. Deception. Everything becomes the same. Individuality is the norm. Everything becomes distorted. The only clarity is the whole. It becomes clear when walking on both sides.

Unify. Become whole. Open up your minds eye. Become one. See with clarity beyond deception. Embrace it all. The good. The bad. Believe only what you know, and accept what you do not. Adapt. Grow. Fight. One life. One shot. Become. Live. Lead.
